# Other Printing

You can also print documents directly from the NurseNotes home screen. There are two ways to do this.

First, you can select a student and click the “Print” Icon in the top right corner (1). This will bring up a screen where you can choose the document language and type (2). You can also choose whether you want to include the address.
