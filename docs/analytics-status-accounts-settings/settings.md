# Settings

Clicking the “Settings” button in the hamburger menu will open the Settings Menu. In this menu, you will find a variety of options that can help you configure NurseNotes to match your preferences. Most of the time, you won’t need to change any of these settings, but they are there in case you want to make any changes.

## Control Methods

On this screen, you will see a picture of a remote control. If you are having problems with your remote control and receiver, you can click the “Update Driver” button in order to install new drivers onto your computer. 

Additionally, if you click on the “Software” tab, you can connect an iPad in order to control NurseNotes during vision testing.

## Vision Settings

The Vision Settings Tab is used to change the settings of certain vision charts. Specifically, Astigmatism and Muscle Balance (Fixation Dot) settings can be updated. Additionally, the computer can be used to show vision charts on a second monitor (Display Options).

You can also use the “Protocol settings” to re-order the charts (e.g. you can do near vision before distance vision, or you can do binocular vision before right/left).

## Audiometry Settings

## Calibration

Calibration is necessary in order for your computer to draw the Vision Screening Optotypes at the correct sizing. 

* To do this, in the “Settings” menu, choose “Calibration”.
* Diagonally measure your computer's screen, in inches. (Don’t include the frame of the screen).
* Then enter that measurement into the field on top of the image of a screen.
Click the “x” in the top right to exit the Settings menu.
